** CHAPTER 1
   + Time Value of Money
   + Cash Flow Diagrams
     + Draw a CF diagram
** CHAPTER 2
   + Recognition and conversion of cash flows
   + Shifted Series
** CHAPTER 3
** CHAPTER 4 & 5
*** TYPE of Alternatives 
    single Project
    If PW/AW/FW at MARR >= 0, *ACCEPT*
    
*** SOme Definintions (VERY IMPORTANT
    - Capitalized worth
      \begin{equation}
       (CW)-  CW= \frac{AW}{i}
      \end{equation}
   -  COST (CC)- 
    
   - Present worth of \infty lives

** CHAPTER 6: Rates of Return (going to have to read)
   
  - *Internal Rate of Return* (IRR) is _not_ always unique.
  - *External Rate of Return* (ERR) is _always_ always unique.
  
    These two are not ranking methods.   ??? What does that mean
    
    When analyzing several alternatives, and incremental approach is applied
    
    Conclusions from PW/AW/FW/B/C GIVE The _SAME_ result.

*** INcremental IRR/ERR Analysis 
    These are the steps required to do an IRR/ERR Analysis

    1) Order the alternatives (two alternatives) by the _initial_ investment
     
    2) Develop the incremental cash flow series. Draw an _icremental_ cash flow diagram, if needed.


    ??? what is an incremental cash flow diagram

    3) Find the Incremenal rate of reutn for this series, term it \Delta i^{*}

    4) Select the better one
       + If \Delta i^{*}_{B-A} < MARR then select A
       + If \Delta i^{*}_{B-A} >= MARR then select B    
       
** CHAPTER 8: Depreciation
*** Concepts
    - Depreciation in _not_ cashflow
    - it _is_ Deducted from teh taxable income
    - Decreases tax magnitud (Ch.9)

*** Depreciation Methods
    - Straight Line SL (THE SAME AMOUNT EVERY YEAR)
    - DECLING BALANCE (DB): accelerated write-off
      \begin{equation}
    - MACRS----- P= \frac{2}{n}
      \end{equation}

** CHAPTER 9
*** Corporate Income Tax Rates   
    + VIEW TABLE 9.1
    
    + Effective Tax Rate (or averaged tax rate)
      + The income tax divided by the taxable income.
    + Incremental Tax Rate
      + The incremental income tax divided by the incremental investment.
    + Marginal Tax Rate
      + The tax rate that will apply to the last dollar included in taxable income.

    EXAMPLES

*** BTCF and ATCF Analysis
    + Before Tax Cash Flow --- BTCF:
      + _ALL_ the cash flows _except_ ~taxes~ and ~loan~ payment
    + After Tax Cash Flow --- ATCF:
      +ATCF = BTCF -Tax - Loan Payment

    Loan Payment = Principal Payment + Interest Payment

    Tax= Taxable Income * (tax-rate)

    Taxable Income =
    = BTCF -Depreciation - Loan Interest Payment

** CHAPTER 11: Break Even Analysis
*** Break-Even Analysis
   + Break-Even Analysis
     + A method ?????
   + Break-Even Value
     + The value of a parameter at whoch the measure of economic worth equates to zero
       ????
   + EXAMPLE

*** Sensitivity Analysis
    + A method used to determine the impact on the measure of economic worth when values of ~one or more parameters~ vary over specified ranges.
***  Break-Even Analysis
    + incorporates explicityly random variation in one or more parameters
    
    + Then  finds a risk measure (PW/AW/FW)
    
    + Or/and, finds the probaility of economic worth to be greater than 0 ( or IRR/ERR > MARR)
